# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Joe. I'm a software-guy with a passion for computers, electronics, science and software. I spend my free time working on projects that are quirky and sometimes laughably bad - but always educational. I write about my projects at [samela.io/blog](https://samela.io/blog/archive) and run the podcast [Host The World](https://hosttheworld.org). If you're interested in hiring me, my resume is available at [samela.io/resume](https://samela.io/resume).
